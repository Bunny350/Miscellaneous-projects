# Shelves from my lair

This lists all the shelves that have been open-sourced for everyone to enjoy. There are two variants: one that only be placed with filaments and a 800x180mm shelf panel, and one that can place PolyDryer boxes and the network infrasture or a UPS, with panel mounting as bonus.

## 18cm filament shelf

18cm is a maximum depth the shelf will accept. It can hold 9 spools of 1kg filament if there are accessories, or up to 11 of them without any in-between accessories. This shelf is easy to build, but the main bracket requires a printer that's at least Ender 3.

## Rackmount network + filament shelf

Dubbed "the most powerful shelf ever made," This shelf can house an entire rackmount UPS of around 25kg while storing up to 6 - 7 spools of 1kg filament and 4 PolyDryer boxes, or 14 spools of 1kg filament. This shelf requires cleats to support the weight of the UPS and the rest of loads.

## Important note
Please see it's CAD files on how it will be built.

Avoid drilling the plastic screw plugs just because of it requiring a high force, or the shelf will sag (I tried).

For the network shelf, you may test the payload vs sag test where you must look out for any sags within 7 days of test operation. If there are sags within seven days then you need to stow it as soon as you can.
