# Shelves from my lair

This lists all the shelves that have been open-sourced for everyone to enjoy. There are two variants: one that only be placed with filaments and a 800x180mm shelf panel, and one that can place PolyDryer boxes and the network infrasture or a UPS, with panel mounting as bonus.

## 18cm filament shelf

18cm is a maximum depth the shelf will accept. It can hold 9 spools of 1kg filament if there are accessories, or up to 11 of them without any in-between accessories. This shelf is easy to build, but the main bracket requires a printer that's at least Ender 3.

## Rackmount network shelf

Dubbed "the most powerful shelf ever made," This shelf can house an entire rackmount UPS of around 25kg while storing up to 7 spools of 1kg filament and 4 PolyDryer boxes, or 14 spools of 1kg filament. This shelf requires cleats to support the weight of the UPS and the rest of loads.

## Important note
Please see it's CAD files on how it will be built. Some parts (bottom part of ) are not mirrored on CAD and you have to do it yourself.
