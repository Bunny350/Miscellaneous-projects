# Bonsai Lab BS01 Frame
This folder contains **now-removed** Bonsai Lab BS01 frames, but *in STEP format(‼️)*. It is known that the frame can be printed by the printers with dimensions of over 280mm*260mm (like for example Bambu Lab H2 series or Voron Trident / 2 in 300mm specs).

## How did I do it
Well, I have to surf in the extended version of such frame and then shrink it back to normal, until I found the cutout for the normal version. But before these, I want to buy such frame from second-hand seller due to it's obsolescence. It was De Agostini idbox that was based of Bonsai Lab BS01, which one has divisions gone and one that was defunct. But when I was trying to buy from the seller they didn't give me any response (not ghosting, it has a different meaning!) but at least I already have another plan since I have a bigger printer that can print such frames.

## Backstory (very short)
The frame was built on acylic. When I accidentally turned the (foldable) table, the frame dropped and shattered. The table's leg distances are nearer than the top.

## Licensing
These frames are obtained [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4s1gcwe7lmhg1u65k48fj/AIez8DbWM4uW5T9wzajLFA4?rlkey=kygho6ewc2qqnrwk3bydk3qaw&e=1&st=idodvdh4). Sadly the company seemed to be defunct so if this file ever gets deleted, I might put the OG there.
