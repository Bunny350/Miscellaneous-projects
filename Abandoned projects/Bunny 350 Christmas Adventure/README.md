## Requirements
* Specific Minecraft JE version 1.12 to 1.12.2.
    * Because 1.13 has changed how commands formatted, most specifically major change to /execute, killing or merging /testfor(block(s)) by or to /execute (if entity / block), and it also cause unexpected warning messages.
        * Issues related to this will **not** be fixed and will be marked **invalid**, as this map was marked scrapped and will not be developed further.
    * If used in earlier versions, commands in the blocks will be removed, and the map will never function commands.
    
## Last-hour changes
This map has been adjusted for public process. As we want it to be reusable (no disposal after overall), this map has a factory reset process.
* There are three major changes done to the first stage, including:
    * Some words has changed, like for example in short sentence we don't say "score of 88," instead we say "scores" or "scored 88". Other stages are included and there will be "something*" and * means the term is modified during last hour change.
    * Added force NBT modifications to leaves during the first stage. The build apparently not just detects for blocks but also the blocks' NBT data, which made winning impossible. This is to work around and potentally complete such stage.
    * Resetting after stage is possible. The cloned build will be removed after completing the first stage.
* [There is this stage where you place the presents by dropping, but one of the house wasn't been complete since many years ago.](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1DBNaZA9Zz/) The place was going to be huge but because I wasn't fast-and-quick enough and became too late to Christmas 2017 it wasn't complete. Probably the former is true.
