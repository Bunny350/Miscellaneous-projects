# Miscellaneous-projects
This repository lists miscellaneous projects and models I worked.
## Products

You can find products that weren't happy to be put on it's own repository. Sometimes with my joke brand "Rbit".

* [HDDBOX](/hddbox) - Hard disk drive storage box. It is 3D printed.
* [X-tier USB head](USB%20head%20(X-tier)) - a head designed all by me in-house. Only 240W allowed.

If these names only show in their own brackets, but not blue text, then it is not yet released, and it should be coming soon.

If you want to find non-joke projects that is being improved for years to come or forever, you need to find their own repositories placed in my [own account](https://github.com/Bunny350)

## History

Oitswilliam's Rbit was early enough. It's published in August 2020. Except that I ditched it later in 2023, and it's right now trademarked by some company.
