This repository lists miscellaneous projects and models I worked.
## Products

You can find products that weren't happy to be put on it's own repository. Sometimes with my joke brand "Rbit".

* [HDDBOX](/hddbox) - Hard disk drive storage box. It is 3D printed.
    * It was intended to be printed via PETG.
* [X-tier USB head](USB%20head%20(X-tier)) - a head designed all by me in-house. Only 240W allowed.
    * I printed the inner shell via PETG while the outer shell was printed via ABS.
    * It is prone to breaking so print it at your own risk.
* [Shelves from my lair](Shelves%20from%20my%20lair) - the shelves design that replaced the OG IKEA shelf brackets that was used since the beginning of such shelf. (Sorry I typed shelf like "piggie" where it replaced the proper y with inproperly interperted "ie".)
    * I printed it via PETG. Although ABS / ASA also works.
* [Suspicious converter (SUS-verter)](Suspicious%20converter%20(SUS-verter)) - A spool-to-filament compatibility converter that allows use of Bambu Lab filaments on non-Bambu reusable spools. It makes filaments so suspicious that someone not knowing this thing will say it isn't Bambu. Sadly I only have two of the reusable spool that isn't from Bambu, the rest are Bambu.
    * The Bambu filament's cardboard shield has a outer diameter of 81mm.
    * Currently, there is only BING3D variant, with the inner diameter of around 76mm.
    * Old eSun spools with two M6 screws for refilling or eSpool spools are incompatible. the inner diameter of such spool is 90mm. Although eSpool+ fits without any accessories.
    * These parts should be printed on PETG or ABS.

If these names only show in their own brackets, but not blue text, then it is not yet released, and it should be coming soon.

If you want to find non-joke projects that is being improved for years to come or forever, you need to find their own repositories placed in my [own account](https://github.com/Bunny350)

## History

Oitswilliam's Rbit was early enough. It's published in August 2020. Except that I ditched it later in 2023, and it's currently trademarked by some company.
