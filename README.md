# Miscellaneous-projects
This repository lists miscellaneous projects and models I worked.
## Products

You can find products that weren't happy to be put on it's own repository. Sometimes with my joke brand "Rbit".

* [Rbit logo] <!-- (/Rbit%20logo)--> - (NYR) Show and shill the logo of Rbit! Any manufacture method available. (CNC, Laser cutting / engraving or 3D printing)
* [HDDBOX](/hddbox) - Hard disk drive storage box. It is 3D printed.
* [Fridge] <!-- (/fridge)--> (NYR) - Refrigerator for standard soda cans. It was made when I was interested in peltier fridge.

If these names only show in their own brackets, but not blue text, then it is not yet released, and it should be coming soon.

If you want to find non-joke projects that is being improved for years to come or forever, you need to find their own repositories placed in my [own account](https://github.com/Bunny350)

## History

Oitswilliam's Rbit is early enough. It's published in August 2020. Except that it's right now trademarked by some company.
