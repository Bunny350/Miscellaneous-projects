# Rbit
The most absolute joke brand I have come up with.
## Products

You can find products with the name "Rbit" or "rbit" with, however, in some cases, it wasn't a joke. This repository shows only "rbit" as joke brand.

* [Rbit logo] <!-- (/Rbit%20logo)--> - Show and shill the logo of Rbit! Any manufacture method available. (CNC, Laser cutting / engraving or 3D printing)
* [rbit hddbox](/hddbox) - Hard disk drive storage box. It is 3D printed.
* [rbit fridge] <!-- (/fridge)--> - Refrigerator for standard soda cans. It was made when I was interested in peltier fridge.

If these names only show in their own brackets, but not blue text, then it is not yet released, and it should be coming soon.

If you want to find non-joke files, you need to find their own repositories placed in my [own account](https://github.com/Bunny350)

## History
