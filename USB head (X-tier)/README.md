# USB head (X-tier)
This is a head-shell of the USB-C port I worked on.
## BOM
* A length of wire mesh with the diameter of 4mm.
* At least of total 4cm of heat shrink tubes with the minimum diameter of 6mm, adhesive lined (hot glue inside) is recommended.
* Length*2 of at least 22AWG wire, I prefer FEP.
* Length*4 of data wires, raw copper wires work the best, I used the Ethernet cable that can only be salvaged and get me free extra.
* A pair of USB-C plugs with PCB, 240W max power and at least one of them having an E-marker chip. If one of it has no E-marker chip, and the length is less than 2 meters, then it can be fine.
* 8x M2*3*3 heat set inserts.
* 8x M2*6mm FHCS (flat head cap screws).
* Red, green and yellow heat shrink tubes are recommended, if you need them, they should be in between 1 and 1.5 mm in diameter.
* A multimeter, used to test the matching connections.

## Parts
This shows the quantity of the parts.
2x head sub-assembly.
2x bottom cover
2x top cover (the one with chanfered holes)

## Assembly
* Cut the wires to the length you need, including 22AWG wires and the data wires. You have to stretch (not heavily) & measure before cutting.
* Cut the wire mesh to the length you need. You may need to cut a bit more to make sure the printed parts can fit.
* Solder the start of the connections, most connectors need matching connections. A great tip of wiring the connections is to add a color-coding heat-shrink tubes.
* You should also put the color-coding heat-shrink tubes to the end of the wires.
* You can then put the wire mesh in, this may take long.
* You will then need to take the adhesive lined heat shrink tube to shrink against the start of the wire mesh, but don't heat it too much as the mesh may deform.
* Solder the end of the connector, and then use the multimeter to check the continuity to see if the wiring pin match.
* Once you are happy and the connections are matched, you can put another of adhesive lined tube to the end of the wire mesh and shrink it.
* You can then place the head (head.stl) sub-assembly to each port.
* Put heat set inserts to the four holes of each bottom cover.
* Attach the covers to the head of the pair of USB-C port. And boom you are done.
