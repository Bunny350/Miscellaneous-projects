# HD desiccant case
This case is called HD desiccant case because it holds any type of desiccant *in diameters that are within 3mm to 5mm*. It has 2mm wide grills that improves drying performance when being dried by normal filament dryers. Becuase of this, salvaging desiccant bags for this is not recommended as they contain pellets that are smaller than the case's grill.

Since I don't like other desiccants for their strict tolerances **(after printing)** and the outcome of it's smaller pellet compatibility with poorer drying performance, I decided to make it myself. Heavily relied on thin extrude feature that introduced four years ago, and simple locking mechanism.

## Recommended materials
* ABS
* ASA

* PET-G
    * May be minorly distortied by heat under high heat mode. However this does not affect the performance.

* Just don't make it via PLA or PVB as these will have insanely obvious problems.

## Requirements
* The printer (and material) must handle 0.2mm tolerances.
    * If the printer cannot handle 0.2mm tolerances, including but not limited to the lid not slotting into the bottom case, then try drying the material first, before adjusting on the slicer- and printer-side.


## Assembly
* Carefully fill the desiccant case (desiccant_bottom_casing) using the desiccant of your choice.
* Close the desiccant case with the lid (desiccant_top_lid). Turn the lid clockwise to lock it. It may make a click.

## Disassembly
If HD desiccant did not dry properly, or for whatever reason, you can easily disassemble it, as easy as assembling it.

* Turn the lid counter-clockwise, and then carefully pull the lid up
* The desiccant can be removed and rejuvenated without the case.
